### A bit about me 👨‍💻
__I'm a developer from Poland, mainly focusing on front-end web development__
I'm actively learning and practicing coding concepts, to get a very good understanding of them. I believe that the most powerful way to learn is to reverse engineer projects you like or big ones (Facebook, YouTube etc.) alongside practicing every day. I strive towards greatness, and that's what matters to me the most.

## My specialities
- ReactJS
- JavaScript (TypeScript)
- HTML
- CSS
