### A bit about me 👨‍💻
__I'm a developer from Poland, mainly focusing on front-end web development.__

I'm actively learning and practicing coding concepts, to get a very good understanding of them. In my projects I focus on user experience, readability and responsiveness as well as effective use of third party services (APIs, databases etc.). I strive towards greatness, and that's what matters to me the most.
